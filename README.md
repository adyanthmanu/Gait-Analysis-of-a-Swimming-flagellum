# Gait-Analysis-of-a-Swimming-flagellum

Implemented a code on PyElastica to compute the mechanics of soft filaments using Cosserat rod theory and 2nd-order Position Verlet time-stepping, to construct a near-realistic model of a swimming flagellum. The gait was optimized using a version of CMAes to find the maximal forward velocity, converging within 4000 generations. The goal of the project was to use the defined equations and constants and showcase the strength of the CMA-es algorithm in achieving realistic computational models of soft materials.
